Improved Google Syncer.

A single login to each account should be necessary, the resulting access token should be stored using the Pickle file format of Python 3.
A field should be added to the Accounts table to contain the refresh token last retrieved and access token presently in usee.
At startup each access token should be used to connect to an account.
The accounts should be cycled through and a new list pulled back from each to compare against items existing in the StoreItem table of the sqlite database.
If the access token is expired, request a new one using the refresh token.
If this is expired, show a link for the user to login and provide a new one.


At some point tracking the file's movements is necessary to prevent duplicate downloads, also if the files disappear online this needs updated in StoreItem.
If the files completely go missing locally, this needs to be updated in StoreItem.

Continuation of a utility that tracks partitions and disks and subvolumes by UUID and Serial Number is a prerequisite. This way duplicates can be discovered.

The ImageDirectories table needs to be configurable. StoreItemLocation needs updated.

Build a bintree including mount location of all files found in the ImageDirectories, and mark them accordingly to allow discovery of duplicates
and their deletion.

Despite that assholes complaints, include video playability and damage checking into the download process, store the errors file in a StoreItem Field with a status flag to indicate damaged if the download is whole.
